project.properties conf file
>> file.stylesheets  = style.css, ie.css, foundation.css


1. HTML5 Boilerplate (+ Build Script)
2. ZURB Foundation 3 (see foundation3 branch)
3. Combination of both best practice web development frameworks with all the goodness of the HTML5 Boilerplate Build Script for versioning and managing!
	* modified directory structure to reflect that expected by the Build Script
	* Build Script contains the necessary modifications taking Foundation into consideration
	* index.html contains all necessary modifications taking Foundation + H5BP into consideration
